# üöÄ ProjectX ‚Äî A Collection of Backend Engineering Projects  
*by [Emmanuel Adebayo](https://github.com/Immaculatedcoder)*  

> A growing collection of backend and full-stack projects I‚Äôm building while mastering Node.js, Express.js, JavaScript, and modern web development.  
> Each project focuses on clean architecture, RESTful API design, and problem-solving ‚Äî from simple utilities to production-ready apps.

## üìò Overview

**ProjectX** is my ongoing developer lab ‚Äî a personal initiative to design, build, and document real-world backend systems.  
Every project in this repository demonstrates a different concept in software engineering such as authentication, APIs, file handling, asynchronous operations, and integration with third-party services.

The goal is to continuously **learn by building**, improve system design thinking, and prepare for real-world software engineering challenges at scale.
